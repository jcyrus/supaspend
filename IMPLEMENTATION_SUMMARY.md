# Fund Management Implementation Summary

## What We've Built

Your petty cash tracker now includes a comprehensive fund management system that allows admins to manage user balances and automatically track spending.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema

- **`user_balances` table**: Stores current balance for each user
- **`fund_transactions` table**: Complete audit trail of all fund movements
- **Automatic triggers**: Handle balance updates on expense create/update/delete
- **Database functions**: Secure server-side logic for fund management

### 2. API Endpoints

#### Admin Endpoints

- `POST /api/admin/funds` - Add funds to users
- `GET /api/admin/funds?userId=...` - Get user balance and transaction history
- `GET /api/admin/users-with-balances` - Get users with balance information

#### User Endpoints

- `GET /api/balance` - Get current user's balance and recent transactions

### 3. Enhanced User Interface

#### Admin Users Page (`/admin/users`)

- **Balance Display**: Shows each user's current balance with color coding
- **Add Funds Modal**: Easy interface to deposit funds to users
- **Transaction History Modal**: Complete transaction history viewer
- **Visual Indicators**: Green/red/gray colors for positive/negative/zero balances

#### Dashboard (`/dashboard`)

- **Balance Card**: Prominent display of user's available balance
- **Balance Integration**: Shows balance alongside expense statistics
- **Visual Warnings**: Alerts for negative balances

#### Expense Form (`/expenses/new`)

- **Balance Display**: Shows current balance before adding expense
- **Balance Preview**: Shows what balance will be after expense
- **Warning System**: Alerts when expense would create significant negative balance
- **Automatic Deduction**: Balance automatically updated when expense is created

#### Reports (`/reports`)

- **Balance Integration**: Reports now show balance information
- **Admin View**: Includes balance data for managed users

### 4. Automatic Balance Management

#### When User Creates Expense:

1. Amount is automatically deducted from balance
2. Transaction is recorded with expense reference
3. Balance can go negative (allows overspending)
4. User is warned if balance goes significantly negative

#### When User Updates Expense:

1. Balance is adjusted for the difference
2. New transaction records the adjustment
3. Maintains complete audit trail

#### When User Deletes Expense:

1. Amount is refunded back to balance
2. Refund transaction is created
3. Balance is restored appropriately

### 5. Security & Permissions

#### Row Level Security (RLS):

- Users can only see their own balance and transactions
- Admins can see balances of users they created
- Superadmins can see all balances and transactions

#### Admin Controls:

- Only admins/superadmins can add funds
- Admins can only manage users they created
- Complete audit trail of who added funds when

### 6. Data Flow

```
Admin adds funds → User Balance increases → User creates expense →
Balance decreases → Transaction logged → Admin can view history
```
